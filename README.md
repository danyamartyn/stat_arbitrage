Automized Statistical Arbitrage on Cryptocurrency


## About the project

This project aims to develop an automated trading model that operates on the principle of statistical arbitrage. The cryptocurrency market on Binance, with over 2000 assets, provides a vast opportunity for this strategy to be applied. By identifying highly correlated coin pairs, the model is able to analyze their historical prices and determine the profitability of a statistical arbitrage strategy.

The statistical arbitrage approach is specifically applied to highly correlated assets. The idea behind this strategy is that when the prices of two assets in a pair move similarly, deviations in their prices can indicate potential undervaluation or overvaluation. In such cases, the model would execute trades to take advantage of these deviations, with the expectation that prices will eventually stabilize, resulting in a profit.

The model automates the process of uploading historical prices, analyzing correlation, and evaluating historical profitability. Pairs that have shown stable income in the past are then selected for real-time trading. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an automated trading model that can consistently generate profits through the application of statistical arbitrage on the Binance cryptocurrency market.
