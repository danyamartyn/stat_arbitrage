Automized Statistical Arbitrage on Cryptocurrency


## About the project

The main goal of this project was to create 
the absolutely automized trading model that 
operates based on statistical arbitrage.

There are about 2000 cryptocurrencies on 
Binance platform. By assuming that there are 
at least 2 highly correlated coins, it was reasonable to apply this approach and check the 
profitability of statistical arbitrage strategy on
Binance.

Statistical arbitrage strategy is applied strickly
on highly correlated assets. The idea of this 
approach is that in highly correlated pair 
(2 assets) prices movement is similar. Therefore,
in case of deviation in prices movement, one asset
in pair might be considered as undervalued and 
another asset in pair would be overvalued. When 
such situation occured, overvalued
asset in the pair should be short (sold), while 
undervalued asset should be long (bought). As 
pair has highly correlated prices movement, after 
some time deviation in prices will be stabilized,
and profit of the deal will be taken on this 
deviation.

The model automatically 
uploads historical prices of all assets,
analyzes their correlation, and checks 
historical profitability of statistical arbitrage 
method. In case when historical profitability 
of a particular pair shows stable income, model 
takes this pair for real time trading and trade on it.
